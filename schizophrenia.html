  <h2>Schizophrenia is a chronic and severe mental disorder that
    affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves. People with
    schizophrenia may seem like they have lost touch with reality.
    Schizophrenia involves a breakdown in the relation between thought, emotion, and behavior,
    leading to faulty perception, inappropriate actions and feelings, withdrawal from
    reality and personal relationships into fantasy and delusion, and a sense of mental fragmentation.
    Although schizophrenia is not as common as other mental disorders,
    the symptoms can be very disabling.</h2>

  <h2>
    Because the causes of schizophrenia are still unknown, treatments focus on eliminating the symptoms of the disease.
    <div><br>Treatments include:</div>
    <div><br>+ Antipsychotics</div>
    -Antipsychotic medications are usually taken daily in pill or liquid form.
    <br>-Some antipsychotics are injections that are given once or twice a month.
    <br>
    <br>+Psychosocial Treatments
    <br>These treatments are helpful after patients and their doctor find a medication that works.
    <br>Learning and using coping skills to address the everyday challenges of schizophrenia helps people to pursue their life goals,
    such as attending school or work.
    <br>Individuals who participate in regular psychosocial treatment are less likely to have relapses or be hospitalized.

    Symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions, usually start between the ages of 16 and 30.
    Individuals with schizophrenia die at a younger age than do healthy people.
    Males have a 5.1 greater than expected early mortality rate than the general population, and females have a 5.6 greater risk of early death.
    Suicide is the single largest contributor to this excess mortality rate, which is 10 to 13 percent higher in schizophrenia than the general population.
    As of Apr. 2018, about 23 million people are affected by schizophrenia. </h2>
