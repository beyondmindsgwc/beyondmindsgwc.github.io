  <h2>
    Dissociative identity disorder (DID) was formerly called multiple personality disorder.
    People with DID develop one or more alternate personalities that function with or without the awareness of the person’s usual personality.
    DID is one of a group of conditions called dissociative disorders.
    Dissociative disorders are mental illnesses that involve disruptions or breakdowns of memory, consciousness or awareness, identity and/or perception — mental functions that normally work smoothly.
    When one or more of these functions is disrupted, dissociative symptoms can result.
    These symptoms can be mild, but they can also be severe to the point where they interfere with a person’s general functioning, both in personal life and at work.

    <br>+ Cognitive-behavioral therapy:
    This form of psychotherapy focuses on changing dysfunctional thinking patterns, feelings, and behaviors.
    <br>+ Clinical hypnosis:
    A treatment method that uses intense relaxation, concentration, and focused attention to achieve an altered state of consciousness, allowing people to explore thoughts, feelings, and memories they may have hidden from their conscious minds.

    The average number of personalities in dissociative identity disorder is two to four upon initial diagnosis.
    The average number of personalities in someone with multiple personality disorder is <br>13 to 15 over the entire course of treatment.
    It is unusual, but there have been cases in which more than 100 personalities have been reported.
    The 12-month prevalence of dissociative identity<br> disorder among adults in a small U.S. community study was 1.5%.
    The prevalence across genders<br> in that study was 1.6% for males and 1.4% for females.
