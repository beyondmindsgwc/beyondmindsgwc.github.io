  <h2>
    Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that's triggered by a terrifying event â€” either experiencing it or witnessing it.
    Most people who go through traumatic events may have temporary difficulty adjusting and coping, but with time and good self-care, they usually get better.
    If the symptoms get worse, last for months or even years, and interfere with your day-to-day functioning, you may have PTSD.
    Getting effective treatment after PTSD symptoms develop can be critical to reduce symptoms and improve function.

  <h2>Rates of PTSD are higher among veterans and others whose vocation increases the risk of traumatic exposure (e.g., police, firefighters, emergency medical personnel).
      Highest rates<br> (ranging from one-third to more than one- half of those exposed) are found among survivors of rape, military combat and captivity, and ethnically or politically motivated internment and <br>genocide.
      About 7 or 8 out of every 100 people (or 7-8% of the population) will have PTSD<br> at some point in their lives.
      8 million adults have PTSD during a given year.
      This is only a small portion of those who have gone through a trauma.
      10 of every 100 women (or 10%) develop<br> PTSD sometime in their lives compared with about 4 of every 100 men (or 4%).
